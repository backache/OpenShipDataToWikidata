# OpenShipDataToWikidata
Go through a list of Wikidata ID's that have MMSI's and backfill any missing data it can find from the API of OpenShipData

Have commented out the insertion of co-ordinates as a few people felt though the data was accurate it should only be used for ships that no longer move (for tragic or retirement reasons)
